# lap1_challenge

# As you have all been developing for a few weeks now, we can assume we are familiar with Google! So, letâ€™s dive into it a bit more and rebuild it. Try to make this look as much like Google as possible, use your developer tools skills to get some hints! 
# You will be working in pairs for this challenge and teaming up with another pair to give feedback via PR review.

# Requirements

# Your version of Google should have a homepage, with a logo, search bar and two buttons.
# Upon pressing one button an API call should be executed and users should be shown a page with ten results.
# Upon pressing the other, users should be taken to the page of one of the results.
# NB: You are creating your own API. It is up to you if you want to make use of the Google Search API in addition but it is not a requirement. Your API can have a limited selection of 'result' options that might be returned for a few search terms
