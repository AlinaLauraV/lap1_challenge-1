# LAP 1 Code Challenge
As you have all been developing for a few weeks now, we can assume we are familiar with Google! So, letâ€™s dive into it a bit more and rebuild it.
Try to make this look as much like Google as possible, use your developer tools skills to get some hints! \
You will be working in pairs for this challenge and teaming up with another pair to give feedback via PR review.

## Requirements
- Your version of Google should have a homepage, with a logo, search bar and two buttons.
- Upon pressing one button an API call should be executed and users should be shown a page with ten results.
- Upon pressing the other, users should be taken to the page of one of the results.
